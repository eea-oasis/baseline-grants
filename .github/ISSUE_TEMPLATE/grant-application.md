## Grant name
Building common data schemas and methods of data translation so that data can be synchronized between systems of record

## Applicant background
Tim O'Brien has been an integration architect for 18 years. During his career he has consulted as an Integration Architect for large banks, Citi,  Deutsche Bank, Aozora. Tim O'Brien worked for Google building cloud architecture. Tim's most recent endeavor has been as CTO of Ferdon where he applied his patents to build advanced blockhain solutions.

## Motivation and overview
Building common data schemas and domain models  simplifies integration by reducing  the potential  number of transfermations from NxN to N (N is the number of participants). Transformation and validation is often the most CPU intense operaton in an integration system so can cause a performance bottleneck. The specific requirements will be analyzed including format (in-flight and at rest), tranformation methodologies, and hardware requirements. The Sr members of the Baseline Protocol team will be consulted on decisions and presented with arguments why the choice is optimal.  


## Execution risks
-  The task must be well defined so as not to "boil the ocean". The analasys phase must product well defined goals that align with the baseline protocol's roadmap for the work to have high relevancy. 

## Downsides


## Tasks and schedule (milestones if applicable)

Milestone  1 -   Analasys complete. At this point the solution should be well documented. 
Milestone  2 -   Data definitions and transfromation mappings defined using spreadsheets. 
Milestoone 3 -   Fully documewnt mplementation including working sample code that demonstraints how the product.  


## Budget and justification
10,000 USD 
The work should take approximatly 6 weeks.
